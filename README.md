# Guessing game - Python test

The game was made in order to enhance my understanding of Python programming language. 

In this game, I applied recursion, OOP, Singleton design pattern and some programming techniques. The details of implementation will be included in the weekly report.

## Game play: 
The game starts when player accepts starting the match. A game might contains multiple matches. 

A match consists of many rounds. The behaviours of each round are sequentially listed below: 
* Initially, a card is given to both house and player. 
* While house must show its card, player must guess whether his/her card is greater than the house card.
* If the guess is correct, the player wins the round and asked whether he/she wishes to continue the match.
* Otherwise, the player is forced to continue the game until he/she wins to make the decision or the deck runs out of card. 

Any bonus or punishment follows the given instruction

## Run the game: 
The game uses Python3 and runs on terminal. To start the game, one should enter the directory and run:
`python main.py`

The game is merely to revise and study. It does not encourage any gambling behaviours.
Play smart and have fun.
